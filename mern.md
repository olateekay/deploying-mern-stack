Install Node.js with the command

`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Note: The command above installs both nodejs and npm.

*Application Code Setup*

Create a new directory for your To-Do project:

`$ mkdir Todo`

verify that the `Todo` directory is created with 

`$ ls`


Now change your current directory to the newly created one:

`$ cd Todo`

Next, you will use the command `npm init` to initialise your project, so that a new file named `package.json` will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Follow the prompts after running the command. You can press `Enter` several times to accept default values, then accept to write out the `package.json` file by typing yes.
